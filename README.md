# Should I stay or Should I Go?

- Should I Stay Or Should I Go is a front end project developed by Kimberly Brown, Matteo Meza, Will Darkins, and Jared Chesebro'

- The page uses API's from https://disease.sh/ and https://platform.seatgeek.com/

- These API's work together to give the user data on covid and any events in the state so they can make an informed decision when they travel.

- We used HTML CSS, and Javascript

- The Pure.css framework was used for styling.

- There's also some moment.js used for date formating

- Eventually the page will display the results on a secondary page.

- Another goal is to set up some sort of email submission so that the user could have the results sent to them.

- Deployed at: https://chesebro11.github.io/Group-Project-1/
